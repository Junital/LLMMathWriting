**Minimax Entropy Learning for Human-like IQ Test Tasks**

Minimax entropy learning aims to create models that can learn and adapt in a manner similar to human beings, particularly when tackling tasks such as those found in IQ tests. This approach involves learning hidden concept characteristics from a set of contextual data, denoted as $C = \{x_i\}$. The objective is to estimate a distribution $p(x)$ that effectively captures these hidden concepts.

The core of this learning process is framed as a maximization problem with entropy as the primary focus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_p &-\int p(x) \log p(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \\
\text{subject to} &\underset{x \sim p(x)}{\mathbb{E}}[H_j(x)] = \mu_j^{\text{obs}}, \quad \forall j \\
&\int p(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 1,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\{H_j(\cdot)\}$ represents a set of response functions that model different aspects of the hidden concepts, and $\mu_j^{\text{obs}}$ is the observed average response in the context $C$.

The analytic solution to this maximum likelihood learning problem is given by:

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left[-\sum_j \lambda_j H_j(x)\right],
$$

where $Z = \int \exp\left[-\sum_j \lambda_j H_j(x)\right] \, \mathrm{d}x$ is a normalizing constant, and $\lambda_j$ are the optimal Lagrangian multipliers found through this process.

The minimax entropy learning objective can also be interpreted through the lens of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, aiming to minimize the divergence between the true distribution $p^*(x)$ and the approximated distribution $p(x)$:

$$
\underset{p}{\min} -\int p(x) \log p(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \underset{p}{\min} \mathbf{KL}(p^*, p) = \underset{p}{\max} \mathbb{E}_{p^*}[\log p(x)].
$$

This objective aligns with the task of maximum likelihood learning, leading to the following optimization problem:

$$
\max_{\lambda, z} \mathbb{E}_{x_i}[\log p(x_i)] = \mathbb{E}_{x_i}\left[-\sum_j \lambda_j z_j H_j(x_i) - \log Z\right],
$$

where $z_j$ are global instrumental variables that help in optimizing the objective.

The complete formulation of the minimax entropy learning objective, incorporating the optimal parameters $\theta_j^\star$ for the filters $H_j(\cdot; \theta_j)$, is written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{\lambda, z} \ \ \  \mathbb{E}_{x_i}[\log p(x_i)] &= \mathbb{E}_{x_i}\left[-\sum_j \lambda_j z_j H_j(x_i; \theta_j^\star) - \log Z\right] \\
\text{subject to} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \theta_j^\star &= \arg \min \ell_j(\{x_i\}, \theta_j), \quad \forall j,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\theta_j^\star$ are the parameters that best fit the filters to the observed data, minimizing the loss function $\ell_j$ for each filter $H_j$.

In summary, minimax entropy learning seeks to align the estimated distribution $p(x)$ with the hidden concept characteristics observed in the context set $C$, achieving a balance between maximum likelihood estimation and entropy maximization. This approach ensures the model captures the complexity of human-like learning in tasks such as IQ tests.
