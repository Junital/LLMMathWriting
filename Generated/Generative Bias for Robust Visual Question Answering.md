**Bias Model for Visual Question Answering (VQA)**

In the context of Visual Question Answering, we introduce a bias model to address the issue of distribution bias present in VQA datasets. The bias model consists of a generator and a bias component, which collectively aim to produce answers that are less biased and more accurate. The key components and loss functions for the bias model are defined as follows:

### Bias Model Module

The bias model is represented by \( F_{b, G}(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{q}) \), which includes both the generator and the bias model. It takes as input a noise vector \(\mathbf{z}\) and a question \(\mathbf{q}\), and outputs an answer.

### Ground Truth Loss

The primary loss function used for training the VQA model is the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss, denoted as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{GT}(F_{b, G}) = \mathcal{L}_{BCE}(\sigma(F_{b, G}(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{q})), \mathbf{y}_{gt}),
$$

where \(\mathbf{y}_{gt}\) is the ground truth answer and \(\sigma\) represents the sigmoid function.

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Loss

To further refine the bias model, we introduce a discriminator \(D(\cdot)\) that attempts to distinguish between answers generated by the real VQA model and those generated by the bias model. The GAN loss is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{GAN}(F_{b, G}, D) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{y}}\left [ \log \left ( D\left (\mathbf{y}\right )\right )\right ] + \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{y}_b}\left [ \log \left (1- D\left (\mathbf{y}_b\right )\right )\right ],
$$

where \(\mathbf{y}\) represents the real answers and \(\mathbf{y}_b\) represents the answers generated by the bias model.

### Knowledge Distillation Loss

To ensure that the bias model's output closely aligns with that of the target VQA model, we employ a knowledge distillation loss based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{distill}(F_{b, G}) = \mathbb{E}_{v, q, z}\left [ D_{KL} \left (F(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{q}) || F_{b, G}(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{q})\right )\right ],
$$

where \(F(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{q})\) is the output of the target VQA model given the visual input \(\mathbf{v}\) and question \(\mathbf{q}\).

### Total Loss Function

The overall loss function for the bias model combines the GAN loss, knowledge distillation loss, and ground truth loss, weighted by hyperparameters \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\):

$$
\mathcal{L}_{GenB}(F_{b, G}, D) = \mathcal{L}_{GAN}(F_{b, G}, D) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{distill}(F_{b, G}) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{GT}(F_{b, G}).
$$

In this formulation, the bias model \( F_{b, G} \) aims to minimize \(\mathcal{L}_{GenB}(F_{b, G}, D)\), while the discriminator \(D\) aims to maximize \(\mathcal{L}_{GAN}(F_{b, G}, D)\). This adversarial setup helps in reducing the distribution bias and improving the accuracy of the VQA model.
